# What is or should be here

## a Dockerfile

I (jbb) wrote the Dockerfile, based on the docker-smsn one.

## apache-tinkerpop-gremlin-server-3.4.2

This is the latest Gremlin Server, downloaded from 
https://tinkerpop.apache.org/downloads.html

I've moved it to ~/probably-to-nuke to that it won't get backed up.
