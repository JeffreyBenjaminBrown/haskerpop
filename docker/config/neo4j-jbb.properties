### Setting a nonexistent option seems to cause no problems,
### so below I am covering every possibility -- whereby 2 lines become 6.
### The following "2" lines mimic what Joshua Shinavier uses for SmSn,
### except sometimes I use conf.dbms rather than conf,
### for parallelism with the above. Also "allow_store_upgrade"
### may have been changed to "allow_upgrade", as documented here:
### https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/reference/configuration-settings/
### so I use both of those.

gremlin.neo4j.conf.dbms.allow_format_migration =true
gremlin.neo4j.conf.allow_format_migration      =true
gremlin.neo4j.conf.dbms.allow_upgrade          =true
gremlin.neo4j.conf.allow_upgrade               =true
gremlin.neo4j.conf.dbms.allow_store_upgrade    =true
gremlin.neo4j.conf.allow_store_upgrade         =true
